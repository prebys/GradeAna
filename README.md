# GradeAna

Simple routines to make analysis plots for grades.  Designed to work with grades exported
from the GradeBook in Canvas.

The main file is GradeAna.py, which uses the csvutil.py utilities.  It's hardcoded
to read the file totals.csv, in which the columns are cut and pasted from 
the exported gradebook file.

Usage:

> python3 GradeAna.py
